# Welcome to IACS Python summer camp

Hi and welcome to the website for the **IACS Computes! HS summer camp**. During this camp, students will learn Python programming skills, get to know research challenges for which coding is necessary, and solve several issues from various disciplines, such as robotics, mathematics, artificial intelligence, natural language processing, etc.

- **Dates:** 13-25 August, 9am-3pm
- **Location:** IACS, Stony Brook University, NY
- **Instructors:** Alëna Aksënova, Sanket Deshmukh, Ayla Karakas

**Please find the documents that we discuss in class in [this folder](https://github.com/loisetoil/IACS_computes_2018).**
On this page, you will find information about the [schedule](#schedule), [materials](#materials), and how to [install anaconda](#anaconda-installation).

> Talk is cheap. Show me the code.
